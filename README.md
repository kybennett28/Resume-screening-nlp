# Resume Screening NLP

## Overview
This project uses natural language processing (NLP) techniques to analyze and rank resumes based on their similarity to a given job description. The goal is to demonstrate an end-to-end NLP workflow using real-world text data.

## Features
- Text preprocessing and normalization
- TF-IDF vectorization
- Resume-to-job-description similarity scoring
- Basic evaluation using similarity thresholds

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK / spaCy
- Jupyter Notebook

## Project Status
Work in progress. The model and evaluation pipeline will be iteratively improved.
